          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Scope and validity of the Terms of Use</h3>
          <p>
            The Terms of Use (henceforth &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) of Blockchain
            Presence AG (henceforth &ldquo;BCP&rdquo;) govern the rights and
            duties related to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the use of all services and products offered by BCP through its
              decentralized application (henceforth the &ldquo;Platform&rdquo;),
            </li>
            <li>the use of the Platform itself, and</li>
            <li>
              the contractual relationship between BCP and its registered users
              (henceforth &ldquo;Members&rdquo;).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Terms are complemented by the BCP Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>
            By using the Platform, any user (henceforth &ldquo;User&rdquo;)
            agrees to be bound by the Terms.
          </p>
          <h3>1.2 BCP Platform</h3>
          <p>The Platform is composed of</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the website{" "}
              <a href="http://www.blockchainpresence.net">
                blockchainpresence.net
              </a>{" "}
              (henceforth the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;),
            </li>
            <li>the BCP Smart Contract, and</li>
            <li>
              the Sender Convenience Application (henceforth the
              &ldquo;SCA&rdquo;);
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            BCP makes its Platform available to Users for the purchase and sale
            of data points on the Ethereum Blockchain.
          </p>
          <h3>1.3 No control over the public blockchain</h3>
          <p>
            The use of services and products offered on the Platform, as well as
            the registration, may involve the use of a public blockchain
            (Ethereum, BinanceSC, Polygon, Tezos, and others). The use of the
            public blockchain may require the payment of a fee (called
            &ldquo;gas&rdquo;) for the execution of the consensus protocol
            (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and others). Such a fee, or part of
            it, may be due even in the case of a failure of a transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users acknowledge and agree that BCP has no control over the public
            blockchains, their specific methods of payment, or any actual
            payment of transaction fees therein. Accordingly, Users must ensure
            that they have a sufficient balance of the blockchain&rsquo;s native
            cryptocurrency (e.g., Ether for Ethereum) stored in their private
            wallet to complete any transaction on the Platform before initiating
            such a transaction.
          </p>
          <h3>1.4 Modifications to the Terms</h3>
          <p>
            Within the limits of the applicable law, BCP reserves the right to
            review and change the Terms at any time. Users and Members are
            responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms. Continued use of the
            Platform and/or the Website after such changes shall constitute
            Users&rsquo; and Members&rsquo; consent to such changes.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>2. Use of the BCP Platform</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Responsibility of Users</h3>
          <p>
            On the Platform, Users may autonomously and in their own
            responsibility, conclude agreements among themselves. The
            fulfillment of the contractual obligations lies within the exclusive
            responsibility of the contracting parties.
          </p>
          <h3>2.2 Legal status of BCP</h3>
          <p>
            BCP is not a contracting party in any agreement that is concluded
            among Users. BCP, its directors, agents, employees, auxiliaries,
            shareholders, and investors are in no way responsible for any risk
            associated with the initiation, conclusion, and fulfillment of
            transactions between Users, and are not liable for any possible
            resulting damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            BCP is not obliged to control the behavior of Users in connection
            with their use of the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            BCP does not guarantee that Users behave on the Platform, according
            to the principle of good faith. In particular, BCP does not
            guarantee that Users fulfill any obligation arising from agreements
            concluded among each other.
          </p>
          <h3>2.3 No right of use</h3>
          <p>
            There shall be no right nor claim to registration, use of the
            Platform, or use of any service or product offered by BCP. In
            particular, BCP may, at its sole discretion, at any time, and for
            any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to the violation of
            the Terms, refuse a registration, exclude a Member (terminate its
            membership), or prohibit the use of a product or a service to a
            Member.
          </p>
          <p>
            BCP may as well, at its sole discretion, at any time, and for any
            reason whatsoever, modify, discontinue, suspend, or terminate the
            offer of a product, a service, the Website, or the Platform.
            <br /> BCP shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by
            any User or Member resulting from any refusal of registration,
            exclusion of a Member, prohibition of the use of a product or a
            service to a Member; modification, discontinuation, suspension, or
            termination of a product, a service, the Website or the Platform.

            Registration is open only to natural or legal persons capable of
            acting without restriction. Minors (persons under the age of 18) are
            excluded from registration. All information required for the

            event of changes to the required information, Members are required
            to update it immediately.
          </p>
          <h3>3.2 Beginning and termination of Membership</h3>
          <p>
            Membership begins with the successful registration on the Website.
            Receivers may terminate their membership at any time. Senders may
            terminate their membership at any time, provided that they do not
            have open commitments or pending orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, BCP has the right to terminate any membership at

            and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo;. BCP does not represent or warrant
            that the Website, the Platform (including any related data), and any

          <p>

            BCP due to violation of their rights through any possible use of the
            Platform by a Member or a User, such Member or User shall release
            BCP from any possible claim and assume all costs of BCP legal
            defense (including court and lawyers&rsquo; fees).

            parts of such provisions, shall remain valid and enforceable.
            Invalid and/or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by such
            valid and enforceable provisions that correspond to the spirit and
            purpose of the invalid and/or unenforceable provisions and are
            closest to them from an economical perspective. The same applies to
            any possible legal loophole in the Terms.
          </p>
          <h2>11. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction</h2>

          <p>
            Members and Users agree that all controversies, claims, and disputes
